James Runyon

I am currently a senior working on obtaining my bachelors degree in computer science.

I grew up in a small town in Iowa called Shenandoah. I graduated from Shenandoah high school in 2015. After I graduated I earned my associate of science from Iowa Western at my local campus. I decided to major in computer science due to the many opportunities the degree offers as well as the diverse set of relevant jobs.

After I graduate I plan on moving to a larger city to pursue a career in tech. My first choice would be to work at a major company as a programmer, but I am open to exploring all options. Something interesting about me is that I visited New York and Washington D.C. last year.
